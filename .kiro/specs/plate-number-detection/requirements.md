# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a license plate detection system using YOLOv5n (nano variant). The system will process images or video streams to identify and localize license plates within the frame, providing bounding box coordinates for detected plates.

## Glossary

- **Detection System**: The complete software application that performs license plate detection
- **YOLOv5n**: The nano variant of the YOLOv5 object detection model, optimized for speed and efficiency
- **Bounding Box**: A rectangular region defined by coordinates that encloses a detected license plate
- **Confidence Score**: A numerical value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's certainty about a detection
- **Input Source**: An image file or video stream provided to the Detection System for processing
- **Detection Result**: The output containing bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class labels

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to load and initialize the YOLOv5n model, so that the system is ready to perform license plate detection

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Detection System SHALL load the YOLOv5n model from a specified file path or download it automatically
2. WHEN the model loading fails, THE Detection System SHALL provide an error message indicating the failure reason
3. THE Detection System SHALL validate that the loaded model is configured for license plate detection
4. THE Detection System SHALL complete model initialization within 10 seconds on standard hardware

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provide images as input, so that the system can detect license plates in those images

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Detection System SHALL accept image files in common formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
2. WHEN an image is provided, THE Detection System SHALL preprocess the image to match YOLOv5n input requirements
3. THE Detection System SHALL validate image file integrity before processing
4. IF an invalid or corrupted image is provided, THEN THE Detection System SHALL return an error message without crashing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect license plates in images, so that I can identify their locations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image contains one or more license plates, THE Detection System SHALL return bounding box coordinates for each detected plate
2. THE Detection System SHALL provide a confidence score for each detection
3. THE Detection System SHALL process a single image and return results within 2 seconds on standard hardware
4. WHEN no license plates are detected, THE Detection System SHALL return an empty result set without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter detection results by confidence threshold, so that I can control the quality of detections

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Detection System SHALL accept a configurable confidence threshold parameter between 0 and 1
2. THE Detection System SHALL return only detections with confidence scores above the specified threshold
3. WHERE no confidence threshold is specified, THE Detection System SHALL use a default threshold of 0.25
4. THE Detection System SHALL allow threshold adjustment without requiring model reloading

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visualize detection results, so that I can verify the system is working correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Detection System SHALL provide a function to draw bounding boxes on the input image
2. THE Detection System SHALL display confidence scores alongside each bounding box
3. THE Detection System SHALL save annotated images to a specified output directory
4. THE Detection System SHALL preserve the original image resolution in annotated outputs
